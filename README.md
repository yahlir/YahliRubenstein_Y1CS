# YahliBot

Hello and welcome to YahliBot, with this chatbot, users can engage in a basic conversation, ask for a joke, a fun fact and even ask for the weather in a specific city.
In this project, I used the 'random', 'pyjokes', 'randfacts' and 'requests' libraries. In addition, I used the OpenWeather API.

## Installation

Use the cmd to install external libraries.

```bash
pip install pyjokes
pip install randfacts
pip install requests
```

## Expandability

In this project, I only scratched the tip of the iceberg regarding the capabilities of a chatbot.
More steps that I think can the level of this chat are:
1. Increasing the number of scenarios in the 'responses' dictionary in order to make the boat more engaging and capable.
2. Add more external libraries & APIs, for example: with 'api-football' the bot could give the user information about upcoming matches.
3. Integrate the bot into a flask ran website, adding a front-end to the bot would make it more user friendly.
4. Using NLP libraries and other chatbot specific libraries in order to increase the bot's capabilities. A library I thought about using is 'chetterbot'.
